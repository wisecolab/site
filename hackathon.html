                    rural areas in India. Using our collective intelligence, we build on solutions that have an impact today.
                    Teams will be challenged to come out of their comfort zone and experience the joy of letting go of mental
                    constructs. We can already announce that Professor Sugata Mitra will spend a few days at the Hackathon to ask 
                    questions teams have never been asked before.
